## Course Overview

DNA is one of the most ubiquitous forms of information in our nature.  In the last 20 years, DNA sequencing technologies have evolved in a breathtaking pace, much faster than Moore’s law, revolutionizing multiple domains from personalized medicine to forensics. This course is going to cover the interface between computer science and the DNA sequencing revolution. Specifically, this course will focus on the newest phase of the DNA sequencing revolution: the advent of low-cost mobile devices that can form the basis of 'the Internet of living things’. Students will have hands-on experiments with these devices, which include data gathering and analysis.  

## Acknowledgments

## Assignments and grading

### Reading assignments
You are expected to read the paper and understand the main concepts and terms before the class.

### Supplemental material
These are mainly review articles that discuss material that will be covered in the frontal class (and much more). It is mainly for reference and crious students. 

### Presentations
The class has a few lessons that include presentations of the teams. The length of each presentation is 10min and will be delievered by one member of the team. To encourage fairness and participation, the presenter will be randomally selected at the begining of the presentation.

### Coding/Written assignments
Teams are expected to code their own assignments. It is OK to brainstorm high level ideas with other teams. It is OK to consult online forums. However, the submitted code should be fully written by members of the team. No exception.
To maximize impact all code should be submitted under GNUv2 liscence. 

### Grades

+ Participation in class discussions: 25%
+ Hackaton1: 25% (10% presentation + 15% code submission)
+ Hackaton2: 25% (10% presentation + 15% code submission)
+ Final project: 25%

## Text books
DNA sequencing and genomics are fast moving fields. The course therefore does **not** have a text book and will relies on research manuscripts and reviews.
However, below I listed a few technical and non-technical books for interested students that would like to get a broader perspective on these fields:

+ **A Short Guide to the Human Genome** \| Stewart Scherer (an excellent technical overview of different elements of the human genome, such as the length of each chromosome and what is the longest gene)
+ **Introduction to Quantitative Genetics** \| Falconer (a technical overview that presents the statistical foundations of analyzing the genetic basis traits)
+ **The $1,000 Genome** \| Kevin Davies (an excellent book non-technical book on the history of DNA sequencing)
+ **The Create Destruction of Medicine** \| Eric Topol (Chapter 5 provides a non technical overview on sequencing and genomics and their impact on precision medicine)
